sultan-kernel-bruce-linaro3
===========================

This kernel is designed for AOSP-based ROMs on the HTC Sensation (Pyramid). The defconfig used to build the kernel is sultan_defconfig and the toolchain I use to build the kernel is Linaro (Linaro GCC 4.8.X also works with this kernel). The toolchain I use to build the kernel can be downloaded from here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2098133
